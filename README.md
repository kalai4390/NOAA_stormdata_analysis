# NOAA stormdata analysis

This work presents an analysis of the NOAA dataset and answers the following questions

1. The type of events which were most harmful to the health of a population in the United   States

2. The type of events which had the greatest impact on the economy in the United States


 Weather events cause problems for both public health and economy. Many severe events  result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database is used in this study. This database tracks the characteristics of major storms and weather events across United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The analysis reveals that tornadoes are most harmful w.r.t. polulation health. Flashfloods have been the top cause for damage in property accounting for billions of dollars.
